# Powershell scripts

Various powershell scripts written for work.
Every script is provided 'as is'.

Pull requests and issues are welcome!

But keep in mind: if a bug/improvement requires several hours to fix it and I'm not directly affected by it I probably won't fix it.  

| script   | description   | environment |
